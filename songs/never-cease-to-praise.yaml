elements:
  verse1:
    - May we run this race, may we keep the faith;
    - May our eyes be fixed on Jesus
    - That we'll not lose heart in our struggle with sin,
    - And through suffering know endurance.
    - May we arm ourselves with the mind of Christ
    - To rejoice in trials and be not surprised.
    - May our hearts be so consumed by You
    - That we never cease to praise.
  verse2:
    - May our company be the saints You've called
    - May we all stand firm in one spirit,
    - That the gospel's truth may resound on earth,
    - That all living things may hear it.
    - May the fruits of faith mark the path we trod
    - Through the life of Christ to the glory of God.
    - May our hearts be so consumed by You
    - That we never cease to praise.
  verse3:
    - May the words we share be Your grace and peace
    - May our tongues speak your proclamations,
    - That the many parts of the Body of Christ
    - Be affirmed in their right relation.
    - As we long and wait for our Groom to come
    - May we learn to love and spur each other on.
    - May our hearts be so consumed by You
    - That we never cease to praise!
  verse4:
    - When that day arrives, and the race is won,
    - When our griefs give way to deliverance.
    - We will fully know as we're fully known,
    - All our groans will end as new songs begin.
    - And a multitude from every tribe and tongue,
    - Wearing robes of white,
    - Will stand before your throne
    - And our hearts will be so consumed by You
    - That we'll never cease to praise!
    - May our hearts be so consumed by You
    - That we never cease to praise!
