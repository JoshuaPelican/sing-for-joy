    - In our struggle with sin,
    - And through suffering
    - Know endurance.

    - May we arm ourselves
    - With the mind of Christ
    - To rejoice in trials
    - And be not surprised.

    - That we never cease to praise.

    - The saints You've called

    - May resound on earth,
    - That all living things
    - may hear it.

    - That we never cease to praise.
  verse5:
    - May the words we share
    - Be Your grace and peace
    - May our tongues speak
    - Your proclamations,
    - That the many parts
    - Of the Body of Christ
    - Be affirmed in their
    - Right relation.

    - That we never cease to praise!
  verse7:
    - When that day arrives,
    - And the race is won,
    - When our griefs give way

    - As we're fully known,
    - All our groans will end
    - As new songs begin.

    - And a multitude from
    - Every tribe and tongue,
    - Wearing robes of white,
    - Will stand before
    - Your throne
    - And our hearts will be so consumed by You
    - That we'll never cease to praise!
    - May our hearts be so consumed by You
    - That we never cease to praise!
