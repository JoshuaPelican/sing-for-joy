name: All Sufficient Merit
author: The Worship Initiative, Bethany Bernard

arrangement: [verse1, verse2, chorus, verse3, chorus, verse4, chorus, chorus]

elements:
  verse1:
    - All sufficient merit shining like the sun
    - A fortune I inherit by no work I have done
    - My righteousness I forfeit at my Savior's cross
    - Where all sufficient merit did what I could not

  verse2:
    - In love He condescended eternal now in time
    - A life without a blemish the Maker made to die
    - The law could never save us
    - Our lawlessness had won
    - Until the pure and spotless
    - Lamb had finally come

  chorus:
    - It is done it is finished
    - No more debt I owe
    - Paid in full all sufficient
    - Merit now my own

  verse3:
    - I lay down my garments any empty boast
    - Good works now all corrupted by the sinful host
    - Dressed in my Lord Jesus
    - A crimson Robe made white
    - No more fear of judgment
    - His righteousness is mine

  verse4:
    - All sufficient merit firm in life and death
    - The joy of my salvation shall be my final breath
    - When I stand accepted before the throne of God
    - I'll gaze upon my Jesus
    - And thank Him for the cross
    - Yes I'll thank You for the cross
