name: Joy Has Dawned Upon The World
author: Stuart Townend, Keith Getty

arrangement: [verse1, verse2, verse3, verse4]

elements:
  verse1:
    - Joy has dawned upon the world,
    - "Promised from creation:"
    - God's salvation now unfurled,
    - Hope for every nation.
    - Not with fanfares from above,
    - Not with scenes of glory.
    - "But a humble gift of love:"
    - Jesus born of Mary.
  verse2:
    - Sounds of wonder fill the sky
    - With the songs of angels,
    - As the mighty Prince of Life
    - Shelters in a stable.
    - Hands that set each star in place,
    - Shaped the earth in darkness,
    - Cling now to a mother's breast,
    - Vulnerable and helpless.
  verse3:
    - Shepherds bow before the Lamb,
    - Gazing at the glory;
    - Gifts of men from distant lands
    - Prophesy the story.
    - Gold, a King is born today,
    - Incense, God is with us,
    - Myrrh, His death will make a way,
    - And by His blood He'll win us.
  verse4:
    - Son of Adam, Son of heaven,
    - Given as a ransom,
    - Reconciling God and man,
    - Christ our mighty Champion.
    - What a Saviour, what a Friend,
    - "What a glorious mystery:"
    - Once a babe in Bethlehem,
    - Now the Lord of history.
