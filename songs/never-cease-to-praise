Never Cease to Praise
Jeff Bougue

verse1, verse2, verse3, verse4

Verse 1
May we run this race, may we keep the faith;
May our eyes be fixed on Jesus
That we’ll not lose heart in our struggle with sin,
And through suffering know endurance.
May we arm ourselves with the mind of Christ
To rejoice in trials and be not surprised.
May our hearts be so consumed by You
That we never cease to praise.

Verse 2
May our company be the saints You’ve called
May we all stand firm in one spirit,
That the gospel’s truth may resound on earth,
That all living things may hear it.
May the fruits of faith mark the path we trod
Through the life of Christ to the glory of God.
May our hearts be so consumed by You
That we never cease to praise.

Verse 3
May the words we share be Your grace and peace
May our tongues speak your proclamations,
That the many parts of the Body of Christ
Be affirmed in their right relation.
As we long and wait for our Groom to come
May we learn to love and spur each other on.
May our hearts be so consumed by You
That we never cease to praise!

Verse 4
When that day arrives, and the race is won,
When our griefs give way to deliverance.
We will fully know as we’re fully known,
All our groans will end as new songs begin.
And a multitude from every tribe and tongue,
Wearing robes of white,
Will stand before your throne
And our hearts will be so consumed by You
That we’ll never cease to praise!
May our hearts be so consumed by You
That we never cease to praise!
