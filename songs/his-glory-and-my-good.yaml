    - I have seen my Fatherâ€™s glory
    - Revealed in Jesus Christ
    - And the more that I behold Him
    - The more He satisfies
    -
    - When I gaze upon His beauty
    - When I see Him as I should
    - Then my eyes are lifted upward
    - For His glory and my good
  verse2:
    - There is hope in every trial
    - For I can trust the Lord
    - He will turn my heart towards Him
    - And help me bear the thorn

    - So in faith I follow Jesus
    - On the road not understood

    - His glory is my good
  verse3:
    - See the open arms of Jesus
    - Upon the cross that day
    - What they understood as weakness
    - Deserves my every praise
    -
    - For the charge that was against me
    - It was nailed into the wood
    - Yes I know that He has saved me
    - For His glory and my good
  verse4:
    - Would I gladly be made nothing
    - That Christ would be made more
    - Would I seek the only kingdom
    - That far outweighs them all
    -
    - I will stand before my Father
    - Where the faithful saints have stood
    - And with joy my heart shall praise Him
    - For His glory and my good
