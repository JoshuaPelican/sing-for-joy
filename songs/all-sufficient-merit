All Sufficient Merit
The Worship Initiative, Bethany Bernard

verse1, verse2, chorus, verse3, chorus, verse4, chorus, chorus

Verse 1
All sufficient merit shining like the sun
A fortune I inherit by no work I have done
My righteousness I forfeit at my Savior’s cross
Where all sufficient merit did what I could not

Verse 2
In love He condescended eternal now in time
A life without a blemish the Maker made to die
The law could never save us
Our lawlessness had won
Until the pure and spotless Lamb
Had finally come

Chorus
It is done it is finished
No more debt I owe
Paid in full all sufficient
Merit now my own

Verse 3
I lay down my garments any empty boast
Good works now all corrupted by the sinful host
Dressed in my Lord Jesus
A crimson Robe made white
No more fear of judgment
His righteousness is mine

Verse 4
All sufficient merit firm in life and death
The joy of my salvation shall be my final breath
When I stand accepted before the throne of God
I’ll gaze upon my Jesus
And thank Him for the cross
Yes I’ll thank You for the cross
