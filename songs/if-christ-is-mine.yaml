  verse1:
    - If Christ is mine, I need no more
    - He is the greatest gift of all
    - The One who angel hosts adore
    - Now has me safely in His hold
    -
    - His life, my life! His death, my death!
    - All mine, His every righteous breath!
    - '"My precious child", the Father cries'
    - When all of Christ is all of mine!
  verse2:
    - If Christ is mine, my guilt is gone
    - It died with Him upon the tree
    - The weight of sin I held so long
    - Was laid on Jesus there for me
    -
    - O sweet forgiveness! Precious peace!
    - Condemned no more, my soul is free!
    - My weary burden cast aside
    - When all of Christ is all of mine!

    - If Christ is mine, I will not fear
    - Though many stand against His name
    - Above their noise, His voice is clear
    - "Behold! I've overcome the grave!"
    -
    - My living Lord! My risen King!
    - What's left to fear if I'm with Him?
    - For death is swallowed up in life
    - When all of Christ is all of mine!
  verse4:
    - What joy to know that Christ is mine!
    - Who holds me ever in His love
    - The sure foundation of my life
    - Whose grace will always be enough!
    -
    - Though all I have is stripped away
    - Still I rejoice for Christ remains!
    - And when He comes, He'll lift me high
    - For all of Christ is all of mine!
