Verse 1
A thousand times I've failed
Still Your mercy remains
Should I stumble again
Still I'm caught in Your grace
Everlasting,
Your light will shine when all else fades
Never-ending,
Your glory goes beyond all fame

Verse 2
Your will above all else
My purpose remains
The art of losing myself
In bringing You praise
Everlasting,
Your light will shine when all else fades
Never-ending,
Your glory goes beyond all fame

Chorus 1
In my heart and my soul
I give You control
Consume me from the inside out, Lord
Let justice and praise
Become my embrace
To love You from the inside out

Chorus 2
Everlasting
Your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your glory goes beyond all fame
And the cry of my heart
Is to bring You praise
From the inside out
Lord my soul cries out

Tag
From the inside out
Lord my soul cries out

Tag 2
To love you from the inside out
Let Justice and praise
Become my embrace
To love You from the inside out
