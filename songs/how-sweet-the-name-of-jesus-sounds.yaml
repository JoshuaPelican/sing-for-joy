author: John Newton, Brian Davis

arrangement: [verse1, verse2, chorus, verse3, chorus, verse4, chorus, verse1]

elements:
  verse1:
    - How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
    - In a believer's ear!
    - It soothes our sorrows, heals our wounds,
    - And drives away our fear.

  verse2:
    - It makes the wounded spirit whole
    - And calms the troubled breast;
    - "'Tis manna to the hungry soul,"
    - And to the weary, rest.

  chorus:
    - O Jesus, shepherd, Savior, friend,
    - My Prophet, Priest, and King,
    - My Lord, my Life, my Joy, my End,
    - Receive my offering.

  verse3:
    - How weak the effort of my heart,
    - How cold my warmest thought;
    - But when I see you as you are,
    - I'll praise you as I ought.

  verse4:
    - Till then I would your love proclaim
    - With every fleeting breath;
    - And may the music of your name
    - Refresh my soul in death.
