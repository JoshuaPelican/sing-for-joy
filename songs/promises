Verse 1
God of Abraham
You're the God of covenant
And of faithful promises
Time and time again
You have proven
You'll do just what You said

Verse 2
Though the storms may come
And the winds may blow
I'll remain steadfast
And let my heart learn
When You speak a word
It will come to pass

Chorus
Great is Your faithfulness to me
Great is Your faithfulness to me
From the rising sun
To the setting same
I will praise Your name
Great is Your faithfulness to me

Bridge
I put my faith in Jesus
My anchor to the ground
My hope and firm foundation
He'll never let me down

Bridge 2
My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus' name
