Verse 1
God of Abraham
You're the God of covenant
And of faithful promises
Time and time again
You have proven
You'll do just what You said

Verse 2
Though the storms may come
And the winds may blow
I'll remain steadfast
And let my heart learn
When You speak a word
It will come to pass

Chorus 1
Great is Your faithfulness to me
Great is Your faithfulness to me
God from age to age, though the Earth may pass away
Your word remains the same, yeah
Your history can prove there's nothing You can't do
You're faithful and true

Chorus 2
Great is Your faithfulness to me
Great is Your faithfulness to me
From the rising sun
To the setting same
I will praise Your name
Great is Your faithfulness to me

Bridge 1
I put my faith in Jesus
My anchor to the ground
My hope and firm foundation
He'll never let me down

Bridge 2
I'll still bless You
In the middle of my storm
In the middle of my trial
I'll still bless You
When I'm in the middle of the road
And I don't know which way to go, I'll still
I'll still bless You
I've got a reason to bless Your name
You've been faithful, You've been faithful
I'll still bless You (Woah)
I will bless Your name
I will bless Your name (I'll still bless You)
Great is Your faithfulness
