elements:
  verse1:
    - Tempted and tried, we're oft made to wonder
    - Why it should be thus al the day long.
    - "While there are others living about us:"
    - Never seem troubled—though in the wrong.
  chorus:
    - Further along we'll know al about it.
    - Further along we'll understand why.
    - Cheer up my brother, live in the sunshine.
    - We'll understand it all by and by.
  verse2:
    - Tempted and tried, how often we question
    - Why we must suffer year after year,
    - Being accused by those of our loved ones,
    - Though we have walked in God’s holy fear.
  verse3:
    - '"Faithful till death,” said our loving Master.'
    - Short is our time to labor and wait.
    - Then will our toiling seem to be nothing,
    - When we shall pass the heavenly gate.
  verse4:
    - Praise to the Lamb who patiently suffered
    - Laid down His life and rose up again
    - Precious Redeemer there is no other
    - And He will keep us until the end!
  verse5:
    - "Soon we will see our dear, loving Savior:"
    - Hear the last trumpet sound through the sky.
    - Then we will meet those gone on before us.
    - Then we shall know and understand why.
  bridge:
    - Cheer up my brother
    - Cheer up my sister
    - We’ll understand it all by and by
