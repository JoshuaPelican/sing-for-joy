  verse1:
    - O let not this world of sorrows
    - Steal my only hope away
    - For the power of Your gospel

    - That my comforts can displace
    - How my true and greatest treasure
    - Is in You the God of grace

    - Now to the God of every grace
    - Who counts my tears who holds my days
    - I sing through sorrows sing with faith
    - O praise the God of every grace
  verse2:
    - Weary with the weight I carry
    - Give me wings of faith to rise
    - For You know each grief that lingers
    - Through the watches of the night

    - At the cross took up our pain
    - And You lead us on to glory
    - As we trust You God of grace
  verse3:
    - There's a dawning hope before us
    - That I know is soon to break
    - As I wait upon Your mercy
    - Which will swallow every ache
    - Cries of joy and songs of victory
    - When we enter heaven's gates
    - All Your children home together
    - All with You the God of grace
