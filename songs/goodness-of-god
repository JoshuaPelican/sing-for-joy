Verse 1
I love You, Lord
Oh, Your mercy never fails me
All my days
I've been held by Your hands
From the moment that I wake up
Until I lay my head
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God

Chorus
And all my life, You have been faithful
All my life, You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God

Verse 2
I love Your voice
You led me through the fire
In darkest nights
You are close like no other
I've known You as a father
I've known You as a friend
And I have lived in the goodness of God

Bridge
'Cause Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
With my life laid down, I surrender now, I give You everything
Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
